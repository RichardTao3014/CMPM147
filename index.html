					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Hi everyone, my name is Richard. I'm a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Game Design, and I'll be graduating from UCSC this summer.
						The person in the photo is me five years ago (don't ask me why I was that skinnyâ€”these days I look more like a pig!). I'm passionate about game development and particularly skilled in programming with C++. Through my studies and various projects, I've gained experience in both game system design and implementation. For example, I independently developed a chess game based on standard international chess rules, and completed the logic for all piece movements.
						Additionally, I'm actively learning Unity and gradually becoming familiar with the workflow in Unity 6.</p>
